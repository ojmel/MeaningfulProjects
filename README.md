# MeaningfulProjects
Hello, I'm Jamel Simpson. These are a collection of projects that I found engaging and complex. 

## BlackJack
This a project where a recreate a simple interation of blackjack in the browser with javascript/html/css. The highlights are my circumvention of javascript's asyncrohonous execution, introducing a sufficient amount of randomness for card draws, and implementation of original art. 

## CNNModule
Here I create a module to build a custom convolutional neural network. Highlights here are 100% de novo functions from convolution, correlation, propagation all written by hand. My first network was tested on MNIST number dataset with a 92% accuracy. In the future, I want to implemention augmentation functions so that my number predictors works better outside the MNIST dataset and also integrate gpu usage as the training is time-consuming.

## ChimeraPrediction
This repository is the majority of my doctarate work in protein/vaccine design. Highlights are commandline integration and options, scientific impact/publication.

## ChoiceWheel 
I developed an android application where you can customize roulette wheels with different choices to help make decisions between them. Highlights are getting familiar with Kotlin which I found to be quite intricate. 

## MLB
Here I created a SQL database to house MLB game data back from the last 8 years to train a Linear Regression and fully connected neural network to select winning teams. Highlights are integration of webscraping, SQL, machine learning.
