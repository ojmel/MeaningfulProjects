# MeaningfulProjects
Hello, I'm Dr. Jamel Simpson. These are a collection of projects that I found engaging and complex. 

## ChimeraPrediction
This repository contains the core of my doctoral research, where I developed a bioinformatics pipeline combining `AlphaFold2`, `Tensorflow`, `Python`, `Bash` and other computatinoal tools to help researchers design vaccine antigens and predict their structural stability. The tool features a command-line interface with configurable options, enabling end-to-end workflows from antigen sequence design to molecular dynamics simulations. Highlights include deep learning-based property prediction and stability analysis, all optimized for HPC environments. This work has contributed to a peer-reviewed [publication](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012812).

## CNNModule
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) python module entirely from scratch—without using deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. It allows users to manufacture custom CNNs for computer vision tasks. Every core function, from convolution and correlation to forward and backward propagation, was written manually to deepen understanding of neural network mechanics.
The first version was trained and tested on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset, achieving 92% accuracy.

## Monopoly Deal 
This repository contains an online multiplayer implementation of the card game Monopoly Deal, featuring real-time gameplay powered by RPC (Remote Procedure Calls) for communication between clients. The project includes real-time physics for card interactions and 3D modeling of cards and game table created in `Blender`. 

## ChoiceWheel 
This project is an Android application built in `Kotlin` and `Java` that enables users to create fully customizable roulette wheels for a wide range of use cases. It includes functionality for managing multiple wheels, allowing users to switch between configurations and edit options. Designed with efficient state management, this app fostered skill in Android development, and user experience design.

## MLB
This repository contains a `Python` script that was used to train both a Linear Regression (LR) model and a fully connected neural network (FCNN) to predict winning teams for MLB matches. It utilizes a MySQL database housing eight years of game data, integrated with web scraping for automated data collection. LR and FCNN achieved 49% and 51% accuracy respectively on an 80/20 train-test split. Highlights include integration of SQL in python, machine learning, and data wrangling, showcasing end-to-end development from data acquisition to predictive modeling. 

## BlackJack
This project recreates a lightweight browser version of BlackJack in `Javascript`. It demonstrates core front-end development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design principles. The goal was to build a fun interactive game with maintainable code.
