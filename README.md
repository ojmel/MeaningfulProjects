# MeaningfulProjects
Hello, I'm Dr. Jamel Simpson. These are a collection of projects that I found engaging and complex. 

## BlackJack
This a project where a recreate a simple interation of blackjack in the browser with javascript/html/css. 

## CNNModule
Here I create a module to build a custom convolutional neural network with python. Highlights here are 100% de novo functions from convolution, correlation, propagation all written by hand. My first network was tested on MNIST number dataset with a 92% accuracy. In the future, I want to implemention augmentation functions so that my number predictors works better outside the MNIST dataset and also integrate gpu usage as the training is time-consuming.

## ChimeraPrediction
This repository is the majority of my doctarate work in where I developed a tool that combined Tensorflow,AlphaFold2, Gromacs, and other bioinformtatics tools with python/c++/bash to help researchers design vaccine antigens and predict their stability. Highlights are commandline integration and options, scientific impact/publication.

## ChoiceWheel 
I developed an android application with kotlin/java where you can customize roulette wheels with different choices to help make decisions between them.  

## MLB
Here I created a SQL database with python to house MLB game data back from the last 8 years to train a Linear Regression and fully connected neural network to select winning teams. Highlights are integration of webscraping, SQL, machine learning. Regression and Neural Network models trained on 80% of data scored 49% and 51% accuracy. 

## Monopoly Deal 
Here I replicated the card game Monopoly Deal as a online-multiplayer game. Highlights are used of rpc procedural calls for real-time multiplayer. Implementation of realtime physics, and 3D modeling of the cards and table in Blender.
